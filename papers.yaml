    description: In this work, a finite element code was used for the design, optimization and visualization of a comb drive accelerator. In the simulation results, the post-optimization design has high performance in high frequency oscillation operating environment. The optimization is based on the ideal eigenfre-quency and Nelder-Mead method. The 3-D working conditions are realized by testing and comparing the time and frequency domain of pre-optimized and optimized design whose frequency ranges from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz. Finally, the electric potential and capacitance in comb drive are visualized, which shows the better electric signals and displacements.
