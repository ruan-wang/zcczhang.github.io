2020 **Summer Research** with professor Esra Kadioglu Urtis at Macalester College. We first implemented the area coverage approach on unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). We also developed and implemented ***deep reinforcement learning*** based algorithms with simulations and a gym environment for coverage path planning for multiple drones using Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region ***(ACKTR)*** method provided by stable baseline in Python.
