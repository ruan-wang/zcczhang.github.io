This is the final paper for the *20th Annual High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM)*, problem A.<br>
I built models to determine the required number of Drones and every Drone's initial location during the process, and our team applied mathematical methods to make sure the flight route of every Drone and the setting of drone. Then we describe the flight routes according to mathematical language, and finally wrote a two-page memo to the Mayor to report the results of our investigation and make a recommendation as to whether or not to do the aerial light show.
