- ###  Full time research internship for learning, understanding, developing, and optimizing computer vision models to complete intelligent solutions for pathological images at [***Thorough Images***](http://thorough.ai/).

[Weekly Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10F--fGvFPijiZacUawUlXw1b1-bKIR5gRwGxpEDQQqE/edit?usp=sharing)

### Responsibilities:	
- Apply the National Invention Patent as the inventor of anautonomous scoring system for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER-2) after immunohistochemical(IHC) staining, and will be in use in hospitals(ongoing for front end).
- Use traditional computer vision techniques realized by OpenCV library and models with various types of deep learning neural networks realized by TensorFlow and Keras libraries to preprocess, recognize, segment, and classify in the pathological images for various cancers(e.g. invasive breast cancer and gastric cancer).
- to be continued!
